Once upon a time, there was a ###### who lived in a small ######. This ###### was very hardworking and helped the farmer carry heavy loads every day. Unlike other animals, the ###### never complained about the work.

One day, the farmers son tried to trick the ###### into carrying twice the load, but the ###### refused and sat down stubbornly. The ######rs laughed, saying, That ###### may look simple, but it is wiser than you think!

From then on, the ###### became famous in the ###### for its cleverness, and everyone respected the ###### for both its strength and intelligence.
